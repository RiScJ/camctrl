# Using the project manager

```camctrl``` uses the idea of "projects" to separate your work. How exactly you utilize them is up to you. Media within a project are considered separate from media within another. This is important because it allows you to conduct certain actions project-wise: things like stitching frames into timelapses, syncing only certain projects to a remote location, etc.  
###  

The project manager consists of two main areas: a list view on the left, and a control panel on the right.  
###  

The list view contains entries for each of your projects, displaying both their names and the last time you modified the project.  
###  

The control panel contains an assortment of tiles which allow you to interact with the projects. You will find the ability to create new projects, delete projects, select the project you want to work on, and open them to see previews of the media you've captured.
#  

## Creating a new project
To create a new project, tap the "Projects" tile to enter the project manager. Once there, tap the "New" tile. You'll be taken to a context with a single text input, and two buttons to either confirm or cancel. Tap the text input and an on-screen keyboard will appear. Type the desired name for your new project, and tap "Create". If successful, you should see a new project with the name you entered appear in the list view on the left side of the project manager.
#  

## Deleting a project
Scroll through the list view on the left side of the project manager until you find the project you want to delete. Tap its entry, and a highlight bar will move over it. Once highlighted, tap the "Delete" tile. A popup window will appear letting you know that this action cannot be undone, and to make sure you are certain before continuing. If you are sure, tap "Confirm". You should see the project disappear from the list view.
#  

## Selecting a project
To select a project to work on, scroll through the list view until you find it. Tap on it to move the highlight bar over the project in question. Once highlighted, tap the "Select" tile. The project's background color in the list view will change to a bright off-white.
#  

## Using the media previewer
Once you have captured media for a project, you may wish to preview them. To do so, scroll through the list view to find the project in question. Highlight it by tapping its name, as above. Once highlighted, tap the "Open" tile. You will be taken to the media viewer's menu.
###  

The media viewer's menu is similar to that of the project manager, composed of a list view on the left, and a control panel on the right.
###  

The list view contains entries for each media file within the project. The control panel contains an interface for filtering the media, and opening them.
####  

### Choosing a file
Choosing a media file is similar to choosing a project: simply scroll through the list, and select a file by tapping on it. Tap the "Open" tile to view the mediafile. If the mediafile is a video, after opening you will have to tap the screen to start playback.
##  

### Filtering the media
If your project has a substantial number of mediafiles, you may wish to filter them to make them easier to manage. You can do so by checking and unchecking the boxes in the control panel. By default, all filetypes are checked.
