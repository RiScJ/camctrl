# ```camctrl```
Qt-based UI for camera control on the Raspberry Pi's 7" touch display.

## Applications
```camctrl``` is designed to be an embedded solution to producing media for your projects with minimal effort. Images, videos, and timelapses triggerable however you want. GPIO, timed, or just by you pressing a button. Use it to create timelapses of your 3D print projects, with frames syncronized via GPIO triggering to make it appear your print is rising out of nothing.
